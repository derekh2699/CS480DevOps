This artical is titled **WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING? ** but the content of the text puts the emphasis on the appropriateness of the name *engineer* rather than explaining the content of software engineering. The author interestingly pointed out that the name remained this way only because of convention, and there are discrepancies between the definition of engineering and the skills required for software engineering.

### Comment by Antony Sunwoo

It is interesting to think about the implications of the term "engineering" in software engineering, as the article points out. The term "artificial intelligence" also suffers the same result - often, one is not artificially creating a stand-alone being capable of thought, but rather creating a way to solve a problem. One might also find a similar issue in poorly named variables in their code.
